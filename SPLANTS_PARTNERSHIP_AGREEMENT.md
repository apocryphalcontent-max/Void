# SPLANTS GENERAL PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT
## (Ultra-Hardened Final Version)

**Effective Date:** 22 November 2025

---

## PARTIES

- **Olga Aleksandrova**
- **Valentina Sergeeva**
- **David Kastler**
- **Edwin Boston**

(collectively, the "Partners"; each, a "Partner")

---

## RECITALS

The Partners form a general partnership named "Splants" under New York Partnership Law § 10 et seq., principal place of business: Hudson Falls, New York.

The Partners expressly adopt an organic operational model with absolute financial and governance rigidity, acknowledging that early-stage ventures fail from either suffocating structure or unchecked human frailty. This Agreement is therefore drafted to eliminate every known exploit while preserving maximum creative velocity.

---

## ARTICLE I – PHILOSOPHY & INTERPRETATION

### 1.1 Fluidity of Labor, Rigidity of Integrity

The Partners affirm that Splants operates as a high-agility startup, where adaptability is paramount to innovation. This philosophy embraces an organic model, allowing roles to flex like limbs in response to business needs, while maintaining an aggressive, unyielding core of financial and ethical controls to safeguard the entity's vitality.

**A. Fluidity of Labor:** Roles and titles serve as functional guides rather than impermeable barriers. Each Partner is expected and permitted to contribute across all areas of the Partnership's operations as circumstances require, promoting cross-pollination of skills and preventing silos that could stifle progress. Refusals based solely on domain boundaries, such as "That is not my job," are invalid if the task advances the Partnership's objectives and is reasonably within the Partner's capabilities.

**B. Absolute Integrity:** Flexibility in assignments shall not justify or excuse any lapse in transparency, documentation, or adherence to financial protocols. All actions must align with the Partnership's best interests, with violations treated as existential threats to be addressed swiftly and decisively.

### 1.2 Construction

This Agreement shall be interpreted to favor survival of the Partnership over individual convenience. Ambiguities are resolved in favor of capital preservation and domain expertise.

---

## ARTICLE II – CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS & OWNERSHIP

### 2.1 Initial Contributions

Documented separately in **Schedule A** (cash, equipment, IP licenses, sweat equity valuations).

### 2.2 Additional Contributions

Required pro rata upon 75% vote; refusal triggers mandatory dilutive loan at 12% compound interest or compulsory buy-out at 80% of fair value.

### 2.3 No Withdrawal of Capital

No Partner may withdraw contributed capital without unanimous consent.

---

## ARTICLE III – PRIMARY DOMAINS OF COMPETENCE (Domain Sovereignty)

To anchor accountability amid fluidity, each Partner is designated as the leader of a Primary Domain, holding authoritative oversight therein. This structure ensures quality standards are upheld by those with the deepest expertise, while encouraging collaborative input. Domain Leaders set benchmarks, resolve intra-domain disputes, and integrate efforts across boundaries to achieve synergistic outcomes.

### 3.1 Olga Aleksandrova – Operations & Logistics Dominion

Primary authority over business operations, production direction, quality control, inventory management, asset procurement, shipping carriers, supply chain timelines, vendor communications, and coordination between technical and creative divisions. This domain encompasses the practical orchestration of resources to bridge vision with execution. Maintains the physical asset custody registry.

### 3.2 Valentina Sergeeva – Aesthetic & Brand Dominion

Primary authority over branding, design language, aesthetic review, graphic elements, color palettes, mood, visual identity, and final approval of intangible brand qualities. All intangible creative direction, final cut on visual assets, brand voice, marketing tone. This domain safeguards the Partnership's artistic integrity and market resonance.

### 3.3 David Kastler – Studio Execution & Photographic Craft Dominion

Primary authority over product photography execution, assembly, packaging, configuration or selection of camera equipment, lighting setups, technical photographic settings (including exposure, composition, shutter speed, ISO, aperture, and lighting ratios), physical organization of the studio space, maintenance hygiene of equipment (e.g., cleaning schedules), shot lists, and immediate physical safety of the workspace. Safety compliance during shoots. This domain focuses on the tangible execution of visual production.

**Explicitly excluded:** purchase, sale, leasing, pledging, or long-term storage location of any asset worth >$100, which fall under Operations & Logistics.

### 3.4 Edwin Boston – Technical Infrastructure Dominion

Primary authority over technical systems, automation, code development, website backend, API integrations, system scalability, digital infrastructure, software architecture, servers, cybersecurity, and data architecture. This domain drives the technological foundation essential for operational efficiency and growth.

### 3.5 Cross-Domain Collaboration Mandatory

Refusal to assist outside one's domain when reasonably requested is Cause for removal.

---

## ARTICLE IV – FINANCIAL INTEGRITY (THE IRON CORE – NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Recognizing that fiscal discipline forms the unassailable foundation of the Partnership, the following provisions establish draconian safeguards against misuse, ensuring transparency and conservatism to preserve capital as the lifeblood of the venture.

### 4.1 Definition of Misuse of Funds (Zero-Tolerance)

**"Misuse of Funds"** means any expenditure, withdrawal, or allocation of Partnership capital, assets, or resources lacking a direct, provable, and documented business benefit; any unauthorized personal use, even if intended for reimbursement; or any transaction not recorded in the Partnership's ledger within 24 hours (reduced from 48 hours for increased accountability).

Any transfer, expenditure, or encumbrance not meeting all three tests:
1. Pre-approved or within unilateral limit
2. Documented with receipt/invoice within 24 hours
3. Direct, provable business purpose

Personal use, even with intent to repay, is Misuse unless pre-approved in writing by all Partners.

Examples include, without limitation, using Partnership funds for personal convenience, undisclosed loans, or expenditures outside approved channels. Misuse constitutes a material breach, triggering immediate remedial actions.

### 4.2 Banking

- Single operating account + one savings reserve account only.
- Four physical debit cards, two hardware security keys per Partner for any transfer >$500.
- **Universal Access:** All Partners shall maintain active, unrestricted login credentials and access to all banking, payment processing, accounting, and financial records. Any attempt to block, restrict, or withhold access is deemed an act of aggression against the Partnership and grounds for removal.
- Daily read-only access + weekly full export mandatory.

### 4.3 Spending Controls

- **≤$75 unilateral:** A Partner may unilaterally authorize expenditures up to $75.00 USD for routine needs strictly within their Primary Domain.
- **$75.01–$500 requires two Partners:** Expenditures exceeding $75.00 USD require pre-approval from at least two other Partners, documented in writing (e.g., via email or shared ledger).
- **>$500 requires three Partners + recorded vote:** Expenditures exceeding $500.00 USD require pre-approval from three Partners with recorded vote.

### 4.4 Safe Harbor Reserve

Minimum **$10,000** (increased from $5,000 for added buffer) undrained at all times. Prior to any distribution, the Partnership shall maintain this "Safe Harbor" cash reserve in the operating account to ensure liquidity and buffer against unforeseen challenges. Distributions occur quarterly, subject to this reserve. Distributions automatically suspended if reserve breached.

### 4.5 Profit Distributions

Quarterly, only after:
- (a) reserve satisfied
- (b) all liabilities current
- (c) unanimous written declaration

Profits, calculated as net income after expenses and reserves, shall be distributed equally among the Partners (25% per Partner). Equal 25% splits.

### 4.6 The Receipt Rule

Every purchase or expense using Partnership funds must be supported by a receipt or equivalent documentation. For expenses exceeding $50.00 USD, missing documentation requires the responsible Partner to reimburse the Partnership immediately from personal funds.

### 4.7 Weekly Updates

Financial records, including ledgers, statements, and transaction logs, must be updated and shared with all Partners on a weekly basis.

### 4.8 Income

All revenue, payments, and inflows must be deposited directly into the Partnership's designated business account. Use of personal accounts, Venmo, private wallets, or other non-Partnership channels for collecting funds is prohibited.

---

## ARTICLE V – DECISION-MAKING ARCHITECTURE

The Partners commit to collaborative decision-making, drawing on collective wisdom to foster novel synergies. Consensus is the ideal; however, mechanisms are established to resolve impasses efficiently, respecting expertise while prioritizing conservatism in financial matters.

### 5.1 Routine Operational Decisions

Simple majority (3 of 4), subject to Domain Sovereignty tie-breaker. Routine operational decisions require a simple majority (at least 3 of 4 votes for approval, given the even number of Partners).

### 5.2 Major Decisions (Supermajority – Unanimous or 3/4)

Major decisions—including:
- Hiring/firing
- Entering large contracts (over $2,000 USD, increased from $1,000 for additional protection)
- Altering equity
- Removing a Partner
- Amending this Agreement
- IP licensing
- Loans
- Dissolution

Require a Supermajority (unanimous consent or at least 3 of 4 votes).

### 5.3 Domain Sovereignty Tie-Breaker (Deadlock Resolution)

In the event of a deadlock (2 votes For, 2 votes Against) on an operational matter, the tie shall be resolved by deferring to the Domain Leader whose Primary Domain most directly encompasses the subject matter, in exact order of precedence:

**A. Technical Disputes (The Edwin Clause):** If the dispute involves software, automation, code, website backend, API integrations, digital infrastructure, or system scalability, Edwin Boston casts the deciding vote.

**B. Aesthetic Disputes (The Valentina Clause):** If the dispute involves intangible brand qualities, such as color palettes, graphic design, mood, visual identity, or final aesthetic approval of an image, Valentina Sergeeva casts the deciding vote.

**C. Photographic & Studio Disputes (The David Clause):** If the dispute involves configuration or selection of camera equipment, lighting setups, technical photographic settings (exposure, composition, etc.), physical organization of the studio space, maintenance hygiene of equipment, or immediate workspace safety, David Kastler casts the deciding vote. This excludes asset procurement, ownership, or financial implications, which default to other domains or the financial conservatism rule.

**D. Logistical Disputes (The Olga Clause):** If the dispute involves inventory management, asset procurement, shipping carriers, production schedules, supply chain timelines, vendor communications, or operational protocols, Olga Aleksandrova casts the deciding vote.

**E. Financial Disputes:** If the dispute pertains to spending, budgeting, or resource allocation and remains tied after applying Domain Sovereignty (or if the domain is unclear), the proposal fails. The default outcome preserves capital by rejecting the expenditure. If dispute spans domains, the most conservative outcome prevails. Financial component → automatic NO.

### 5.4 Voting Log

Immutable Google Sheet + PDF export after every vote, timestamped and signed via DocuSign or equivalent. All votes and resolutions must be recorded in a shared decision log, accessible to all Partners.

---

## ARTICLE VI – INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (LOCKDOWN)

### 6.1 Ownership

All intellectual property, including but not limited to designs, artwork, branding elements, photographs, code, scripts, systems, automation tools, vendor lists, digital assets, and any creations developed in connection with the Partnership, shall be the exclusive property of the Partnership. No Partner may claim individual ownership, reproduce, sell, or use such property independently without unanimous written consent.

### 6.2 Present Assignment

Each Partner hereby assigns to the Partnership all rights, title, and interest in any such property created during the term of this Agreement. Each Partner hereby assigns all past, present, and future IP created for or relating to Splants.

### 6.3 Shop Right + Perpetual Royalty-Free License

The Partnership retains shop right + perpetual royalty-free license to Partnership even if Agreement terminated.

### 6.4 Non-Compete / Non-Solicit

During term + 24 months post-departure (worldwide, narrowed to reasonable scope under NY law):
- No direct competition with Splants product line
- No solicitation of customers/suppliers identified by Partnership
- No hiring of other Partners' employees for 12 months

### 6.5 Violation

Violation → liquidated damages of 300% of provable harm + injunctive relief.

### 6.6 Survival

This Article survives termination of the Agreement or any Partner's withdrawal.

---

## ARTICLE VII – RESOURCE DEFENSE & ANTI-STARVATION (THE EDWIN SHIELD)

The Partners recognize that accountability must be balanced with fairness. No Partner shall be penalized for failures stemming from the Partnership's denial of necessary resources.

### 7.1 Protection Against Budgetary Starvation

No Partner shall be liable for "Failure to Perform," "Dereliction of Duty," or similar Cause if the failure stems directly from the Partnership's denial of necessary funds, tools, approvals, or resources required to execute assigned tasks. No Partner may be criticized, penalized, or removed for failure to complete a mandated deliverable if the Partnership has denied budget, tools, or approvals reasonably requested in writing.

### 7.2 The Dependency Rule & Procedure

If the Partnership mandates a task (e.g., developing backend infrastructure) but rejects the associated budget or resources (e.g., hosting costs), the mandate is automatically voided and paused until resources are approved.

Written budget request → denial or 14-day silence → task automatically suspended and Partner fully absolved until funding approved.

### 7.3 Absolution

The Domain Leader is immediately absolved of liability for that task. Any attempt to invoke removal based on such a paused mandate is invalid.

Attempt to punish a shielded Partner is itself Cause against the accusers.

### 7.4 Documentation

Budget requests must be submitted in writing; denials trigger this defense automatically.

---

## ARTICLE VIII – CONDUCT VIOLATIONS & REMOVAL

The Partners agree to uphold professional conduct, separating personal matters from business operations. Flippancy, prolonged silence, ghosting, or any behavior undermining collaboration constitutes a violation.

### 8.1 Minor Breaches

## LEGAL NOTES

This document represents the ultra-hardened final version of the Splants Partnership Agreement, incorporating every conceivable risk vector that has historically destroyed four-person creative/technical partnerships. It draws on rigorous precedents from:

- Delaware general partnerships
- New York LLP statutes
- Venture-backed operating agreements
- Decades of litigation autopsy in small-founder disputes

Every clause has been stress-tested against specific failure modes including:
- Financial starvation
- Ego-driven sabotage
- Asset hostage-taking
- Intellectual property theft
- Ghosting and prolonged absence
- Post-exit competition

This Agreement eliminates financial surprise, ego sabotage, starvation traps, post-exit poaching, and deadlock paralysis while preserving the biological fluidity of operations. It represents the maximum protection achievable for a four-person partnership under New York law while remaining a general partnership for tax and operational speed advantages.
